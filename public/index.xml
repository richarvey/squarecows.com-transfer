      <title>Enable Cost and Usage Reports (CUR)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/enable-curs/</link>

      <description>Why choose CUR? In order to analyse your AWS billing in detail you need to switch on Cost and Usage Reporting (CUR). This allows you to see a very fine grained report on your billing data, from on-demand costs to how much of your RI or savings plan is being used. When working with SquareCows we&amp;rsquo;ll ask you to enable this and run the data for at least 30 days in order to cacth month begining and end, which should give us a good idea of your standard usage of AWS and make more informed cost savings calculations.</description>
